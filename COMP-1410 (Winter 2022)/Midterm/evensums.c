// EXPLANATION //

// My implementation of the recursive function goes over every number recursively from n to 0.

// BASE CASE: When n eventually reaches 0 thanks to the recursive case, 0 is returned since adding 0
//            is insignificant

// RECURSIVE CASE: In my recursive case, I have a conditional statement that checks whether the current value
//                 of n is an even number by checking the remainder of n when n is divided by 2. If the remainder is
//                 0, then n is for sure an even number. When this case is true, the current function returns the sum 
//                 of the current value of n (which is an even number) and a new function call where the argument is
//                 n-2 which is guaranteed to be an even number. This continues to happen recursively until n reaches
//                 0. The code in the else block only runs once and that's when the initial value of n ends up being
//                 an odd number. What's returned is the sum of 0 (because in this case, n is odd) and a new function 
//                 call where the argument is n-1 which means the new argument is an even number.
